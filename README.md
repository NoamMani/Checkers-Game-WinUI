# Checkers-Game-WinUI
This project is one of the tasks required in the course "Object Oriented Programming in C# and the .NET Framework".
This project is a Checkers game for a Windows interface.

As part of the course we received a task to program a checkers game for cmd interface. The rules game according to the instructions in the link: http://www.netintellgames.com/checkersrules.htm

We've separated the logical part from the interface part, so we can use it again when will want to replace inetrface for the game. The code written as readable as possible.
